# PersonalGoalAssistant
Personal Assistant for help people to do their daily-monthly-yearly tasks more easily and efficient.

It is ease-to-use and also compitable with many AndroidStudio versions. I didnt share the APK because it can be different SDK versions or cant compitable with phone with user.
App asks for permissions for:
INTERNET
POST_NOTIFICATIONS
WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
READ_CALENDAR
WRITE_CALENDAR

Altough it can be use internet, i managed to make it work without internet connection with SQLbased database.Which that means if you want to store the app-data to inside your device,you can use it that way too!
App dont collect or share data of you which you can check and confirm on source code. If it has any damaged,non-working or collecting data parts inside the main code, please contribute and help the code be more cleaner and safer!
