# PersonalGoalAssistant
Personal Assistant for help people to do their daily-monthly-yearly tasks more easily and efficient.

It is ease-to-use and also compitable with many AndroidStudio versions. I didnt share the APK because it can be different SDK versions or cant compitable with phone with user.

In this app you can:

 Create Tasks
 
 Add Created Tasks Sub-Tasks
 
 Make Reminders for Tasks
 
 Review Old or Deleted Tasks
 
 Use Calendar to Create Dated-Tasks
 
 Change or Add Sub-Tasks and Main Tasks
 
 Can view Tasks on Chart
 


App asks permissions for:
INTERNET

POST_NOTIFICATIONS

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

READ_CALENDAR

WRITE_CALENDAR


Although it requires an internet connection, it can also work without internet. Imanaged to make it work without internet connection with SQLbased database.Which that means if you want to store the app-data to inside your device,you can use it that way too!
App dont collect or share data of you which you can check and confirm on source code. If it has any damaged,non-working or collecting data parts inside if i missed and didnt see in the main code, please contribute and help the code be more cleaner and safer!
